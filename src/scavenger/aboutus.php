<h2>About Samurai Dojo Industries</h2>
<p>Here at Samurai Dojo Industries, we pride ourselves on the quality and quantity of the
products that we make and sell.  We have been doing business since 1982, and are in
11 different countries. Our CEO, Kevin Flynn is second to none when it comes to
eliminating his rivals.</p>
<p>Samurai Dojo Industries is a unique company that was started near the beginning of the
digital revolution.  We were founded exactly one year after the release of the first
IBM PC (5150)Â®.  Since that faithful day, we have been creating the worlds best
products for gaming and destruction, real and fictional.</p>
<p>The first product created was the multi-purpose deadly boomerang Light Disc.
At the time only blue was available.  Within the next few years we were able to
create the fun and exciting Light Cycle.  And of course the Light Disc was able
to power the Light Cycle.  Within the next few years the Light Cycle was refined
and able to leave permanent streams of non-passable light.  We were also able to
increase our colors to include Yellow and Green.</p>
<p>Our management included one of the leaders in technology redistribution (stealing),
Ed Dillinger.  A revolutionist in his management style and ability to lock out or
absorb his competition.  It was from his leadership that our current CEO was created.</p>
